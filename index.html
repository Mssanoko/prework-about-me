      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>While in France before I came live in United States, as an accountant I was most of the time working with the it department; I started to be interesting in everything related to web (designer, devolopment, cyber security). Three years ago, when I came in USA, I told myself that it will be a fresh new start for me in everything I cut my hair, I find a new job as a nanny but I wasn't really happy with it so I remind myself that I really was interested about IT. So I started taking free online classes on the basics (HTML & CSS). One day when I was browsing online I saw this ad about this bootcamp, I took my chance to sign up.  </p>
